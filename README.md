# Lung Cancer Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict lung cancer patient data using Python and machine-learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is named `cancer_patient_datasets.csv`.

## Description
- Analyzed lung cancer patient data using Python, applying pandas for data cleaning and matplotlib for visualizing patterns in demographics, cancer stages, and treatment outcomes.
- Built machine learning models using scikit-learn to predict survival rates and identify key risk factors, presenting findings through interactive visualizations.
- Summarized insights in a professional report, highlighting factors influencing patient outcomes and providing recommendations for treatment strategies.
