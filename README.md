# Lung Cancer Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict lung cancer using machine learning techniques applied to cancer patient datasets. The dataset used for this analysis is named `cancer_patient_datasets.csv`, and it's processed using the Pandas library for data manipulation and visualization.

## Data

The `cancer_patient_datasets.csv` file is utilized in this project. The dataset contains various attributes related to cancer patients, and Pandas is employed to read, explore, and preprocess the data.

## Preprocessing

The data undergoes preprocessing steps to ensure suitability for the machine learning model. This includes:

- **Label Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded using `LabelEncoder()` to transform them into numerical values.
- **Standard Scaling**: The data is standardized using `StandardScaler()` to bring all features to the same scale.

## Feature Selection

Feature importance is determined using the `RandomForestClassifier` and its `feature_importances_` attribute. This step identifies and ranks the most crucial features within the dataset.

## Modeling

After feature selection, the target variables (`X` and `y`) are established for modeling purposes. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`. A `KNeighborsClassifier` classification model is implemented for predictive analysis.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using various metrics:

- **Accuracy Score**: Calculated using `accuracy_score` from Scikit-learn.
- **Classification Report**: Utilizing `classification_report` to obtain precision, recall, F1-score, and support metrics.

## Usage

To use the lung cancer prediction model:
1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn) are installed.
2. Access the `lung_cancer_prediction.ipynb` or `lung_cancer_prediction.py` file to see the code implementation.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the file to replicate or modify the prediction model.

## Future Improvements

- Explore additional feature engineering techniques.
- Experiment with different classification algorithms for potentially enhanced accuracy.
- Develop a more user-friendly interface for the model.
